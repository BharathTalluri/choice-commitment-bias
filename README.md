Code repository for Talluri et al. 2021 JNeurophys

Data can be obtained from the following repositories:<br/>
Perceptual task: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7048430 <br/>
Numerical task: https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.40f6v <br/>
Raw pupil data from Perceptual task: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14039294 <br/>

If you use the data or the code, please cite:
Talluri, B. C., Urai, A. E., Bronfman, Z. Z., Brezis, N., Tsetsos, K., Usher, M., Donner, T. H. (2021) Choices change the temporal weighting of decision evidence. Journal of Neurophysiology.

The repository is organized into the following folders:
1. Data: Contains behavior data (both raw, and analysis-ready) from both perceptual and numerical tasks, and preprocessed pupil data from perceptual task. In addition, matlab scripts that give the analysis-ready data files from the raw data files are provided. All behavior data files are in csv format, and preprocessed pupil data files are in .mat format.
2. Code: Contains all analysis scripts to replicate the figures and other results in the paper.

Note: All the scripts have been commented for readers to understand and any functions used in these scripts that are not built-in have been added. However, please understand that the description may not be complete and if you run into any issues while running the code please contact Bharath Chandra Talluri (bharathchandra.talluri@gmail.com).
